Final Project for Python Programming

Option 2: Game

This is a simple python game that includes graphics and collision detection. There are 3 different types of enemies. Note: You will have to declare an enemy type in enemy.py to see each enemy and its capabilites. The premise of the game is to dodge life events. If the player is hit by one of life's challenges, GAMEOVER.
